      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        During the lockdown, I embarked on a journey to understand how websites
        function and what coding entails. This curiosity led me to explore a
        variety of fascinating fields. I delved into 3D modeling with Blender,
        ventured into game development using the Unity game engine, and, of
        course, learned the fundamentals of web development, including HTML and
        CSS. I even created my first website and found myself captivated by the
        world of coding. Each new skill added another layer of excitement and
        complexity, turning what began as a simple interest into a deep-seated
        passion.
